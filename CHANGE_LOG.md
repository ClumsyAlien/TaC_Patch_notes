Misc notes: The Config is only considered ~70% Complete, settings will be added as 0.3.5.+ continues a patch phase to help contribute edits and fixes over time, addon support I would consider about 85% as well, this means most addons should be portable over to TaC, although will require some hand holding to get going, documentation will be written throughout the patch stage for 0.3.5.+ however will be slow progress due to how much review would be needed, asking to join the Addon Development Group channel in the Discord is most acceptable.
